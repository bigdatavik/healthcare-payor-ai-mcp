Agent: I can help you with that. Let me pull up your account. I see the claim was denied because it was coded as a consultation rather than a preventive visit. The issue is that Dr. Smith billed it as a consultation code 99213 instead of the preventive visit code 99396. Member: But it was my annual physical, shouldn't that be covered? Agent: You're absolutely right. Preventive visits are covered at 100% under your plan. I can see that Dr. Smith's office needs to resubmit the claim with the correct preventive visit code. I'll send them a message to correct this billing. Member: How long will that take? Agent: Typically 5-7 business days for processing. You should receive an updated EOB in the mail. Is there anything else I can help you with today?",

I can see that the MRI was ordered by Dr. Johnson for your back pain. The issue is that it was performed at an out-of-network facility. Your plan covers MRIs at 100% when performed at in-network facilities, but out-of-network has a $1,000 deductible and 30% coinsurance. Member: But Dr. Johnson said it was urgent and the in-network place couldn't see me for 3 weeks. Agent: I understand your concern. For urgent situations, we can make exceptions. Let me check if Dr. Johnson submitted a prior authorization for urgent care. I don't see one in the system. However, I can help you file an appeal based on medical necessity. Member: What do I need to do? Agent: I'll send you the appeal form. You'll need Dr. Johnson to provide a letter explaining why the MRI was medically necessary and urgent. We'll review it within 30 days.",

      "content": "Subject: Urgent - Surgery Authorization Denied\n\nDear Member Services,\n\nI am writing to appeal the denial of my surgery authorization. I was scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) on January 25th, but I received a denial letter stating that the procedure is not medically necessary.\n\nThis is extremely concerning because:\n1. I have been experiencing severe abdominal pain for 3 months\n2. My gastroenterologist, Dr. Martinez, has confirmed gallstones on ultrasound\n3. I have been unable to work due to the pain\n4. Conservative treatment with diet modification has failed\n\nDr. Martinez has provided extensive documentation showing that this surgery is medically necessary. The denial seems to be based on a misunderstanding of my condition. I have attached all relevant medical records and test results.\n\nPlease expedite the review of this appeal as I am in significant pain and the surgery is scheduled for next week.\n\nSincerely,\nSarah Johnson\nMember ID: M456789123",

Agent: I'm sorry to hear about this issue. Let me check your prescription benefits. I can see that your plan covers insulin, but there may have been a change in the formulary. What type of insulin are you taking? Member: I take Lantus and Humalog. Agent: I see the issue. Lantus is still covered, but Humalog was moved to a higher tier in our formulary. However, we have several alternatives that are covered at a lower cost. Member: What are my options? Agent: You could switch to Novolog, which is very similar to Humalog and covered at tier 2, or you could apply for our patient assistance program. I can also help you find a participating pharmacy that might have better pricing. Member: Can you send me information about the patient assistance program? Agent: Absolutely. I'll email you the application and also connect you with our pharmacy benefits team who can help you find the best solution.",

Dr. Williams at Chicago Medical Group is accepting new patients and has excellent ratings. Dr. Brown at Downtown Family Practice is also available. Member: What about Dr. Williams' office hours? Agent: Dr. Williams has office hours Monday through Friday 8am-5pm, with extended hours on Tuesday and Thursday until 7pm. They also offer same-day appointments for urgent issues.
