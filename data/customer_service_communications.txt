TRANSCRIPT:
Member: Hi, I'm calling about my claim that was denied for procedure 99213. I went to see Dr. Smith last week for my annual checkup and now I'm getting a bill for $150.

Agent: I can help you with that. Let me pull up your account. I see the claim was denied because it was coded as a consultation rather than a preventive visit. The issue is that Dr. Smith billed it as a consultation code 99213 instead of the preventive visit code 99396.

Member: But it was my annual physical, shouldn't that be covered?

Agent: You're absolutely right. Preventive visits are covered at 100% under your plan. I can see that Dr. Smith's office needs to resubmit the claim with the correct preventive visit code. I'll send them a message to correct this billing.

Member: How long will that take?

Agent: Typically 5-7 business days for processing. You should receive an updated EOB in the mail. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

KEY ISSUES:
- Incorrect billing code (99213 vs 99396)
- Preventive visit coverage confusion
- Billing resubmission required

TRANSCRIPT:
Member: Can you help me understand why my MRI wasn't covered? I got a bill for $2,500 and I thought MRIs were covered.

Agent: I'd be happy to help. Let me look up your claim. I can see that the MRI was ordered by Dr. Johnson for your back pain. The issue is that it was performed at an out-of-network facility. Your plan covers MRIs at 100% when performed at in-network facilities, but out-of-network has a $1,000 deductible and 30% coinsurance.

Member: But Dr. Johnson said it was urgent and the in-network place couldn't see me for 3 weeks.

Agent: I understand your concern. For urgent situations, we can make exceptions. Let me check if Dr. Johnson submitted a prior authorization for urgent care. I don't see one in the system. However, I can help you file an appeal based on medical necessity.

Member: What do I need to do?

Agent: I'll send you the appeal form. You'll need Dr. Johnson to provide a letter explaining why the MRI was medically necessary and urgent. We'll review it within 30 days.

KEY ISSUES:
- Out-of-network coverage
- Prior authorization missing
- Urgent care exception needed

EMAIL CONTENT:
Subject: Urgent - Surgery Authorization Denied

Dear Member Services,

I am writing to appeal the denial of my surgery authorization. I was scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) on January 25th, but I received a denial letter stating that the procedure is not medically necessary.

This is extremely concerning because:
1. I have been experiencing severe abdominal pain for 3 months
2. My gastroenterologist, Dr. Martinez, has confirmed gallstones on ultrasound
3. I have been unable to work due to the pain
4. Conservative treatment with diet modification has failed

Dr. Martinez has provided extensive documentation showing that this surgery is medically necessary. The denial seems to be based on a misunderstanding of my condition. I have attached all relevant medical records and test results.

Please expedite the review of this appeal as I am in significant pain and the surgery is scheduled for next week.

Sincerely,
Sarah Johnson

- Surgery authorization denied

TRANSCRIPT:
Member: I'm calling about my prescription coverage. My pharmacy is telling me that my insulin isn't covered anymore and it's going to cost me $400 a month.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear about this issue. Let me check your prescription benefits. I can see that your plan covers insulin, but there may have been a change in the formulary. What type of insulin are you taking?

Member: I take Lantus and Humalog.

Agent: I see the issue. Lantus is still covered, but Humalog was moved to a higher tier in our formulary. However, we have several alternatives that are covered at a lower cost.

Member: What are my options?

Agent: You could switch to Novolog, which is very similar to Humalog and covered at tier 2, or you could apply for our patient assistance program. I can also help you find a participating pharmacy that might have better pricing.

Member: Can you send me information about the patient assistance program?

Agent: Absolutely. I'll email you the application and also connect you with our pharmacy benefits team who can help you find the best solution.

KEY ISSUES:
- Formulary change
- Prescription coverage
- Cost concern

Member: I need to find a new primary care doctor. My current one is retiring.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you find a new primary care physician. What area are you looking in?

Member: I live in downtown Chicago, near the Loop.

Agent: Perfect. I can see several in-network primary care physicians in that area. Dr. Williams at Chicago Medical Group is accepting new patients and has excellent ratings. Dr. Brown at Downtown Family Practice is also available.

Member: What about Dr. Williams' office hours?

Agent: Dr. Williams has office hours Monday through Friday 8am-5pm, with extended hours on Tuesday and Thursday until 7pm. They also offer same-day appointments for urgent issues.

Member: That sounds good. How do I make an appointment?

Agent: I can transfer you to their scheduling department, or you can call them directly at (312) 555-0123. Would you like me to transfer you now?
