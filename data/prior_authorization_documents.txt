Procedure Description: Arthroscopy, knee, surgical; with meniscectomy (medial OR lateral)
Diagnosis Codes: ICD10_M23.30, ICD10_M23.31
Diagnosis Descriptions:
- Other meniscus derangements, unspecified lateral meniscus
- Other meniscus derangements, unspecified medial meniscus
Urgency Level: Routine
Status: DENIED
Denial Date: January 18, 2024
Denial Reason: Insufficient documentation of failed conservative treatment

MEDICAL NECESSITY:
Patient has failed 6 months of conservative treatment including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and activity modification. MRI confirms complex tear of medial meniscus with mechanical symptoms including locking and catching. Patient is unable to participate in normal activities and work duties due to knee pain and instability. Arthroscopic meniscectomy is medically necessary to restore function and prevent further joint damage.

CLINICAL NOTES:
Patient is a 42-year-old construction worker with 8-month history of left knee pain following work-related injury. Initial treatment included rest, ice, NSAIDs, and physical therapy. Patient completed 12 weeks of supervised PT with minimal improvement. Current symptoms include severe pain with walking, climbing stairs, and squatting. Patient reports episodes of knee 'giving way' and occasional locking. Physical exam reveals positive McMurray test, joint line tenderness, and mild effusion. MRI shows complex tear of posterior horn of medial meniscus with associated bone marrow edema. Patient has been unable to return to full work duties for 3 months.

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:
- MRI report showing complex medial meniscus tear
- Physical therapy notes documenting 12 weeks of treatment
- Work injury report
- Functional capacity evaluation

DENIAL NOTES:
While MRI shows meniscal tear, documentation does not clearly demonstrate adequate trial of conservative treatment. Patient may benefit from additional physical therapy and activity modification before surgical intervention.
