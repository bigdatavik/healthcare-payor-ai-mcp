    "# MAGIC\n",
    "# MAGIC This notebook walks through the end-to-end process of preparing a **vector search index** based on a synthetic FAQ dataset related to telecom billing.\n",
    "# MAGIC\n",
    "# MAGIC We use Databricks Vector Search to enable high-accuracy semantic retrieval of FAQ entries, forming the foundation for downstream use cases such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based question answering.\n",

    "# MAGIC ## ðŸ“Œ Key Steps in This Notebook\n",
    "# MAGIC\n",
    "# MAGIC 1. **Generate a Billing FAQ Dataset**  \n",
    "# MAGIC    Create a synthetic dataset of frequently asked billing questions and answers, and save it as a Delta table in Unity Catalog.\n",
    "# MAGIC\n",
    "# MAGIC 2. **Configure & Create Vector Search Index**  \n",
    "# MAGIC    - Enable change data feed on the Delta table  \n",
    "# MAGIC    - Create a delta sync index using a specified embedding model  \n",
    "# MAGIC    - Wait for the index to become ready\n",
    "# MAGIC\n",
    "# MAGIC 3. **Test the Vector Search**  \n",
    "# MAGIC    Run a similarity search using a sample query (`\"Can I change my bill due date?\"`) and return the top matching FAQ entries.\n",

    "# MAGIC\n",
    "# MAGIC ## ðŸ§° Requirements\n",
    "# MAGIC\n",
    "# MAGIC - Unity Catalog enabled and configured\n",
    "# MAGIC - Databricks Vector Search endpoint (configured and shared)\n",
    "# MAGIC - A valid embedding model endpoint (e.g., `databricks-gte-large-en`)\n",
    "# MAGIC\n",
